### Example 7: Going Above and Beyond (Salon Business Strategy)
**Question:** Tell me about a time when you went above and beyond to serve a customer. Why did you do it?

I own a small salon business in Toronto, which I had taken over in December 2023 and was looking to improve on current operations. One major challenge I identified was the high turnover rate among employees. The salon industry is highly seasonal, and to maximize revenue, the previous owner followed a strategy of over-hiring to ensure availability during peak times so no customers are turned away. However, this led to higher employee competition and earning lower commissions, causing frequent turnover. I wanted to address this issue by creating a more stable and motivated team, I believe having that would translate to better service quality, customer loyalty. I discussed my concerns with the previous owner, who had experience running multiple successful salons. They believed turnover wasn't a problem and insisted that ensuring availability for every customer was the key to increasing revenue. I disagreed with this approach, and instead of over-hiring, I focused on retaining and investing in my existing employees. I and the current manager, encourage skill development and ensure a fair commission distribution based on skill to keep employee motivated. After implementing this approach, I saw significant improvements. In over a year of running the business, I retained 7 of the original 8 employees, compared to the previous owner's record of having 50 different employees in 3 years. The team also improved their overall skills, allowing them to provide more services. Although peak-time availability was slightly reduced, overall customer and employee satisfaction increased, leading to a more stable business.
