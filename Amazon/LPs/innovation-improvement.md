## Stories

### Example 5: Process Improvement (Security Vulnerability Tool)
**Question:** Describe a situation where you saw an opportunity to improve a process and took action.

When I first joined the company, I was tasked with updating a logging library from Log4j to Log4j2 due to a critical security issue. During this process, I noticed that the way we updated libraries was highly inefficient. Developers would blindly pull versions from the internal package repository, often without checking for vulnerabilities, which required manual research to ensure the updated package was secure. Around this time, I came across an email from RBC promoting a new technology tool that could scan for vulnerabilities in packages. I realized this tool could fit our needs perfectly and saw the opportunity to improve our pipeline to include this tool to automate package vulnerabilities check. I discussed the tool with my manager and proposed using some of my time to explore and integrate it into our code deployment pipeline. After the approval, the integration itself was extremely easy. I shared the result with the team and they appreciated the streamlined process and it since became part of the pipeline in all projects in our team, saving time each time we had to update a package or add a new one.

### Example 10: Simple Solution to Complex Problem (Survey Gizmo)
**Question:** Describe a time when you found a simple solution to a complex problem.

During my co-op at the health network, I worked with a few nurses and HR responsible for getting doctors' credentials re-approved. The process was entirely pen-and-paper, requiring doctors to fill out long forms, which led to delays in collecting, storing, and managing the data. The nurses needed a more efficient way to collect this information, but they weren't sure what a digital solution should look like. I had about two months left in my co-op, which wasn't enough time to build a fully customized UI getting feedback, and go through testing. So to provide a quick yet flexible solution, I researched existing tools and found Survey Gizmo, a platform for building forms with an API for data retrieval. By leveraging this tool, I created a template-based system where nurses could customize the forms as needed. Meanwhile, I integrated the API to pull the required data for further processing. And work on the backend logic. This solution drastically reduced implementation time, and it was delivered before the end of my co-op. Which was way earlier than the users expected, and made it in time for that year re-approval.
