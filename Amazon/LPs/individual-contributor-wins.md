## Stories

### Example 1: Learning New Skillset (NGO Web App)
**Question:** Tell me about a time when you had to learn a completely new skillset to accomplish current deliverables.

A while ago, I volunteered as a web developer for an NGO that helps relocate individuals escaping domestic abuse. They needed help to build an application to manage volunteers, information, and itinerary of the moves. When I joined, we only had Figma designs outlining core functions like volunteer onboarding and move scheduling, but no implementation. We were given a soft six-month timeline to deliver an MVP. At the time, I had little experience, but the volunteer team was also in the same position, so I chose to step up as a core contributor to the implementation of the application. I quickly learned React and Firebase by following tutorials and building small components, which I then applied to the actual implementation. When breaking down Figma designs into actionable features, I also researched open-source APIs to handle tasks like authentication and email services, presenting their pros and cons to the team and helping select the best solutions. I also participated in weekly meetings to prioritize tasks, share knowledge, and keep the team aligned with our goals. We successfully delivered the MVP ahead of schedule. During beta testing at the Halifax branch, the application received great feedback from volunteers, who reported that it significantly reduced the time needed to coordinate available volunteers for moves and they love that there's an electronic record for everything. Although I left the project after completing the MVP, I later heard from the project manager that the nonprofit was transitioning all branches to using the application.

### Example 4: Taking Complete Ownership (Credit Officer Web App)
**Question:** Tell me about a time when you took complete ownership of a project and ensured its success.

Two years ago, my team was tasked with creating a new web application to help credit officers track their portfolio of clients, monitor events affecting their credit, and transition from paper-based quarterly affirmations to electronic record-keeping. I took complete ownership of the project because no one on the team had experience with the required technologies, React and Node.js. While I had some prior experience with these technologies from volunteer work, I saw this as an opportunity to build something from start to finish. To ensure the project success, I collaborated closely with business stakeholders to understand their pain point and requirements. I also researched into external APIs as well as collaborated with teams within RBC to leverage their tools for our need. I also led the development effort building key features. The application was successfully launched on time and received great feedback from directors and credit officers. It streamlined their workflow, reducing the time spent on quarterly affirmations from weeks to just a few days. Due to the success of this project, the leadership are now planning a new initiative to leverage our existing data and build a prediction/analysis dashboard to provide deeper insights into client portfolios. Our team has been chosen to lead this project, thanks to the credibility we earned from delivering the first application.

### Example 11: Database Migration (MySQL to Oracle)
**Question:** Tell me about a time you solved a complex technical problem.

Database migration from MySQL to Oracle. Anticipated compatibility issues, but logic and order of query filters I expected to stay the same. However doing the actual migration, I investigated some bottlenecks and found that MySQL queries behaved differently in Oracle, requiring optimizations. After noticing the change in complexity, I explained the challenges and revised the timeline. I kept my manager informed with daily updates. Despite the initial confusion about the timeline, I was able to deliver this migration before the revised deadline. And all performance testing benchmarks were met. (index, optimizing join and select to only having fields we need. Filter data early with where and limit)

### Example 6: Helping a Struggling Peer (QA Support)
**Question:** Tell me about a time when you saw a peer struggling and how you helped them.

A co-worker on the QA team was assigned to test a change request I was working on, but he was struggling because this was a new project for him. There was added pressure because previous CRs he had tested in another project had encountered production issues. Recognizing that this project was new to the QA team and that he wouldn't be able to get help from his usual team members, I made sure to give him additional support. I started by scheduling a KT session to walk him through the entire project, not just the part we were working on, to help him visualize the system. I encouraged him to reach out whenever he felt unsure, no matter how small the question might be, and collaborated with him to create test cases, showing him how I would approach testing and edge cases. Our QA team usually create their own test cases based on the requirements since it mostly involve testing in the front end, so seemed like overkill at the time, but what matter most was the result and the CR we worked on was successfully released to production without any issues. More importantly, the knowledge he gained from this experience allowed him to build confidence in his testing approach, and since then, I've worked with him on many CRs and together, we have a good record of not introducing prod issues.
