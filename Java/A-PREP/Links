RECRUITER CALL:

-> Introduction

-> Your interest

-> Why Coinbase

The reason I applied to Coinbase is because I really want to work on products that have a meaningful impact, especially in the finance space since I consider it a hobby of mine. Working on a product that scales and is used by millions of people is something I haven’t had the chance to do in my previous roles, and I’m eager to learn and take on the challenges that come with building systems at that scale. Coinbase stands out to me because it’s at the intersection of finance and crypto innovation, I know that there is probably a lot of innovative initative happening here, and I would to work in a fast-pace evironment impactful environment.

-> Questions

What are the interview process? Is there a round for system design for SDE2?
