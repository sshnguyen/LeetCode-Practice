Example 11: Database migration from mySQL to Oracle. Anticipated compatibilities issue, but logic and order of query filters I expected to stay the
same. However doing the actual migration, i investigated some bottlenecks and found that mysql queries behaved differently in oralcle, requiring
optimizations. After noticing, the change in complexity, I explain the challenges and revised the timeline. I kept my manager informed with
daily updates. Dispite the inital confusion about the timeline, I was able to deliver this migration before the revised deadline. And all performance
testing benchmark met. (index, optimizing join and select to only having fields we need. Filter data early with where and limit)



 Tell me about a time when you had to learn a completely new skillset to accomplish current deliverables.
*****ANSWER********EXAMPLE 1
A whiel ago, I volunteered as a web developer for an NGO that helps relocate individuals escaping domestic abuse. They needed help to build an application
to manage volunteers,informations, and itinerary of the moves.
When I joined, we only had Figma designs outlining core functions like volunteer onboarding and move scheduling, but no implementation.
We were given a soft six-month timeline to deliver an MVP. At the time, I had little experience, but the volunteer team is also in the same position,
so I chose to stepped up as a core vontributor to the implementation of the application. I quickly learned React and Firebase by following tutorials 
and building small components, which I then applied to the actual implementation. When breaking down Figma designs into actionable features, I also 
researched open-source APIs to handle tasks like authentication and email services, presenting their pros and cons to the team and helping select the best
solutions. I also participated in weekly meetings to prioritize tasks, share knowledge, and keep the team aligned with our goals.
We successfully delivered the MVP ahead of schedule. During beta testing at the Halifax branch, the application received great feedback from volunteers,
who reported that it significantly reduced the time needed to coordinate available volunteers for moves and they love that there's an electronic records for
everything. Although I left the project after completing the MVP, I later heard from the project manager that the nonprofit was transitioning all branches to 
using the application.



LP2: Tell me about a time when you faced a roadblock. How did you approach it? Was it solved or not? What did you learn?
*****ANSWER********EXAMPLE 2
Recently, a third-party financial API that our financial dashboard application heavily depended on announced it would be decommissioned in two months.
This was a significant challenge because the dashboard relied on this API for most of its data. and I was tasked to find a replacement
that maintained all previous data points and functionalities while staying within the same price point. First thing I did was research to alternative APIs,
No single API provider gives all the datasets that we are looking for, and the price would increase if we had to subcribe to multiple providers.
I had approach the solution it in multiple different ways. First to try and find the API that best fit our need, I had to researching into
external API as well as RBC in-house APIs comparing data points covered and cost. For data points that wasn't in the API, I proposed
and implemented calculating the data from the raw datasets. To stay in budget, I also had to negociate with API providers for better pricing bundles.
In the end, I successfully migrate to new data source without disrupting the dashboard functionality, and kept the price within budget.
This experience taught me adaptability, and the importance of thoughrough research and the value of negotiating for what you need.

*****ANSWER********EXAMPLE 3
During my volunteer work as a web developer, I once took tasks that involved implementing some feature. During sprint planning, I estimated that I could 
complete these tasks within our 2 weeks sprint time. However, I underestimated the complexity of the task, and while working on it, i realized it take significantly more
time tto complete than I initially thought. Usually if I promised to do something, I will try to deliver it, even if it meant working more to make it up, 
however, at this time, I had an important deliverable coming up for my full-time job. I had to prioritize my full time job, and I immediately communicated this
to the volunteer team. I offer to mitigate this delay by breaking the feature up to smaller tasks and ask other volunteers if they can help with some of the
smaller tasks without dependencies. Once I had more time after finishing up my full time job responsibilities, I work on the rest of the tasks to ensure the
feature is completed. This experience of taught me the importance of of realistic time estimation, this mean deeply understand all the tasks that make up a
feature, and proactive communication, because without it, the team would not be able to adjust and help and it would've cause even more delay.


Tell me about a time when you took complete ownership of a project and ensured its success.
*****ANSWER********EXAMPLE 4
Two years ago, my team was tasked with creating a new web application to help credit officers track their portfolio of clients, monitor events 
affecting their credit, and transition from paper-based quarterly affirmations to electronic record-keeping.
I took complete ownership of the project because no one on the team had experience with the required technologies, React and Node.js.
While I had some prior experience with these technologies from volunteer work, I saw this as an opportunity to build something from start to finish.
To ensure the project success, I collaborated closely with business stakeholders to understand their pain point and requirements.
I also research into external apis as well as collaborated with teams within RBC to leverage their tools for our need. I also led the development
effort building key features. The application was successfully launched on time and received great feedback from directors and credit officers.
 It streamlined their workflow, reducing the time spent on quarterly affirmations from weeks to just a few days.
Due to the success of this project, the leadership are now planning a new initiative to leverage our existing data and build 
a prediction/analysis dashboard to provide deeper insights into client portfolios. Our team has been chosen to lead this project,
thanks to the credibility we earned from delivering the first application.


*Additional: Describe a situation where you saw an opportunity to improve a process and took action.
*****ANSWER********EXAMPLE 5
When I first joined the company, I was tasked with updating a logging library from Log42 to Log4j2 due to a critical security issue. 
During this process, I noticed that the way we updated libraries was highly inefficient. Developers would blindly pull versions from the internal
package repository, often without checking for vulnerabilities, which required manual research to ensure the updated package was secure.
Around this time, I came across an email from RBC promoting a new technology tool that could scan for vulnerabilities in packages.
I realized this tool could fit our needs perfectly and saw the opportunity to improve our pipeline to include this tool to automate package
vulnerabilities check. I discussed the tool with my manager and proposed using some of my time to explore and integrate it into our code deployment pipeline.
After the approval, the integration itself was extremely easy. I shared the result with the team and they appreciate the streamlined process and it since
become part of the pipeline in all projects in our team, saving time each time we had to update a package or add a new one.
  

LP1: Tell me about a time when you saw a peer struggling and how you helped them.
*****ANSWER********EXAMPLE 6
A co-worker on the QA team was assigned to test a change request I was working on, but he was struggling because this was a new project for him.
There was added pressure because previous CRs he had tested in another project had encountered production issues.
Recognizing that this project was new to the QA team and that he wouldn’t be able to get help from his usual team members, I made sure to give him
additional support. I started by scheduling a KT session to walk him through the entire project, not just the part we were working on, to help him
visualize the system. I encouraged him to reach out whenever he felt unsure, no matter how small the question might be, and collaborated with him
to create test cases, showing him how I would approach testing and edge cases. Our QA team usally create their own test cases based on the requirements
since it mostly involve testing in the front end, so seemed like overkill at the time, but what matter most was the result and the CR we
worked on was successfully released to production without any issues. More importantly, the knowledge he gained from this experience allowed him
to build confidence in his testing approach, and since then, I’ve worked with him on many CRs and together,we have a good record of not introducing prod issues.


Tell me about a time when you went above and beyond to serve a customer. Why did you do it? How did it impact them?
Additional: Describe a time when you found a simple solution to a complex problem.
*****ANSWER********EXAMPLE 7
I own a small salon business in toronto, which I had taken over in December 2023 and was looking to improve on current operations. 
 One major challenge I identified was the high turnover rate among employees. The salon industry is highly seasonal, and to maximize revenue,
the previous owner followed a strategy of over-hiring to ensure
availability during peak times so no customers are turned away. However, this led to higher employees competition and earning lower commissions, 
causing frequent turnover. I wanted to address this issue by creating a more stable and motivated team, I believe having that would translate to
better service quality, customer loyalty. I discussed my concerns with the previous owner, who had experience running multiple successful salons. 
They believed turnover wasn’t a problem and insisted that ensuring availability for every customer was the key to increasing revenue. I disagree with this
approach, and instead of over-hiring, I focused on retaining and investing in my existing employees. I and the current manager, encourage skill development
and ensure a fair comission distribution based on skill to keep employee motivated. After implementing this approach, I saw significant improvements. 
In over a year of running the business, I retained 7 of the original 8 employees, compared to the previous owner's record of having 50 different employees
in 3 years. The team also improved their overall skills, allowing them to provide more services. Although peak-time availability was slightly reduced,
overall customer and employee satisfaction increased, leading to a more stable business

Describe a situation where you had to move forward with a team decision you didn’t agree with. What did you do?
*****ANSWER********EXAMPLE 8
In our application, we had a batch job that ran daily to pull data from multiple sources into our tables. To meet audit compliance, our team needed to
implement additional processes to ensure data accuracy, correctness, and failure alerts. The proposed solution was to collaborate with the ELT (extract, load, transform)
team, which specialized in standardizing data transfers. My manager supported this approach because it meant shared ownership, dedicated monitoring, 
and support for any compliance changes affecting data transfer job. While I understood the benefits, I advocated for keeping ownership within our team,
as relying on ELT would introduce a dependency, slowing us down when making changes. For example, we would need to go through them for modifications, testing,
and log retrieval. After discussing trade-offs, my manager acknowledged my concerns but ultimately decided to proceed with ELT for standardization.
I committed to the decision and worked closely with ELT team to ensure a smooth transition. I also collaborated with them to implement the necessary audit 
compliance processes. In the end, the collaboration proved beneficial—we leveraged ELT’s resources and monitoring capabilities, and the business
was satisfied as we achieved audit requirements well ahead of the deadline.

Give an example of when you identified potential issues that others overlooked and how you mitigated those risks.
*****ANSWER********EXAMPLE 9

Last year when RBC bought BSBC, our team to work on data migration from HSBC to RBC. We need to move all their clients
and financials information relevant to our project to RBC.
Some member thought the job would be simple and a automated script that would do everything parsing, transforming, validating, and loading the data.
The idea is that the job would require very little manual labour.
and if we find any new issue during testing, we could always update the job. However, I was concerned that a 
fully automated process could easily fail if unexpected data issues arose. Since this is a critical task, and our testing
and implementation windows were very small due to audits and the confidential nature of the data, 
any failure in an automated run during these time would be an issue if we are not able to modify the code in time. 
I proposed a hybrid approach: we would break the automation into multiple components. One part of the script would handle the bulk
of the data transformation, such as parsing and formats. Then we'll create seperate job for different validations. Then any final check will be done manually.
I was able to convince the team to start with this approach by highlighting the fact that this job need to be robust and data accuracy is more important
than speed since ultimately it is a one-time job. When testing, we did discover a lot of unexpected data issue, and the seperation of concern allows
us to quickly address the issue without having to run the entire process. In the end, the migration was implemented in production without issue.

Tell me about a time when you went above and beyond customer needs.
*****ANSWER********EXAMPLE 10

During my co-op at the health network, I worked with a few nurses and HR responsible for getting doctors’ credentials re-approved.
The process was entirely pen-and-paper, requiring doctors to fill out long forms, which led to delays 
in collecting, storing, and managing the data.The nurses needed a more efficient way to collect this information, 
but they weren’t sure what a digital solution should look like. I had about two months left in my co-op, which wasn’t enough time to 
build a fully customized UI getting feedback, and go through testing. So to provide a quick yet flexible solution, I researched 
existing tools and found Survey Gizmo, a platform for building forms with an API for data retrieval.
By leveraging this tool, I created a template-based system where nurses could customize the forms as needed. 
Meanwhile, I integrated the API to pull the required data for further processing. And work on the backend logic.
This solution drastically reduced implementation time, and it was delivered before the end of my co-op. Which was way earlier than
than the users expected, and made it in time for that year re-approval.
