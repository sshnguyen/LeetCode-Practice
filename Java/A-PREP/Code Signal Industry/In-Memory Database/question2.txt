CodeSignal offers a feature called "filesystem questions," which allows candidates to interact with a virtual file system during assessments. These questions can be structured progressively across multiple levels, each introducing additional complexity.

Level 1: Basic File Operations
Objective: Implement fundamental file operations.
Requirements:
Create File: Ability to create a new file in a specified directory.
Delete File: Remove an existing file.
Move File: Move a file from one directory to another.


Level 2: Directory Management
Objective: Enhance the system to handle directories.
Requirements:
Create Directory: Ability to create new directories.
List Contents: List all files and subdirectories within a directory.
Delete Directory: Remove a directory and its contents.


Level 3: File Metadata and Permissions
Objective: Introduce file metadata and permission handling.
Requirements:
Set Permissions: Assign read/write/execute permissions to files and directories.
View Metadata: Retrieve information such as file size, creation date, and last modified date.
Permission Validation: Ensure operations respect the set permissions.


Level 4: Advanced Features
Objective: Incorporate advanced file system functionalities.
Requirements:
Search Functionality: Implement search to find files/directories by name or metadata.
Symbolic Links: Support creation and resolution of symbolic links.
Disk Quotas: Enforce storage limits for directories or users.
