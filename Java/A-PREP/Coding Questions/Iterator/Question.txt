// 1 coding question with multiple parts of 1 hour. I solved 4 parts with working code and passed all test cases.
// Communication is also judged.

// Part 1: Design and code an interleaving iterator. Given 2 arrays output the elements in interleaving order.
// array1 = [1,2,3] and array2 = [4,5,6] -> result = [1,4,2,5,3,6]

// Part 2: Design a range-based iterator with a given start, end and step value.
// (1, 10, 2) -> [1,3,5,7,9]

// Part 3: Design interleaving iterator with a list of iterators

// Part 4: Add a filter function to interleaving iterators
