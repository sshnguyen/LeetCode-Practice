Sure, here's an in-depth explanation of each step for a modern single-page application (seperate front end and backend):

1.DNS & Connection:
DNS Lookup: Your browser first checks its local DNS cache to see if it already knows the IP address for the domain. If not, it sends a DNS query to your configured DNS server, which may recursively query other DNS servers until it finds the correct IP address.
TCP & TLS Handshake: With the IP address, the browser initiates a TCP connection to the server. Since the site uses HTTPS, a TLS handshake occurs where cryptographic keys are exchanged and the server’s certificate is validated, establishing a secure, encrypted channel.

2.Initial HTTP Request:
The browser sends a GET request for the initial HTML shell (typically an index.html file). This file is the backbone of the single-page application and is often served from a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to minimize latency.

3.Asset Loading & Caching:
The HTML response includes references to various assets like JavaScript, CSS, and images. Modern browsers also leverage Service Workers and local caching, so many of these files may be retrieved from cache rather than downloaded again. This speeds up loading significantly.
If an asset isn’t cached, the browser sends additional HTTP requests to download these assets from the CDN or the origin server.

4.JavaScript Initialization:
Once the assets load, the browser executes the main JavaScript bundle. This code initializes the SPA framework (such as React, Angular, or Vue), sets up client-side routing, and registers event listeners. The application then “boots up,” initializing its state and preparing to handle user interactions.

5.API Calls & Dynamic Data:
After initialization, the SPA makes asynchronous API calls (using fetch or a similar method) to the back-end services to retrieve dynamic data (e.g., user-specific content, product listings). These APIs return data in JSON format.
The received data updates the application's state, which triggers UI re-rendering based on this fresh information.

6.Rendering & Interactivity:
The JavaScript framework uses the updated state to dynamically render the content, updating the DOM without requiring a full page reload.
The page becomes interactive as event listeners respond to user actions, and any subsequent API calls continue to update the interface, ensuring a seamless and responsive user experience.
